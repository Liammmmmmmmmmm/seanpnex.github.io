Hiring Manager  
Deutsche Bank  
Investment Bank: Fixed Income & Currencies  
New York, NY  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Deutsche Bank Internship Program within the Investment Bank: Fixed Income & Currencies division. As a current Master of Engineering in Fintech student at Duke University, and with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics & Computational Science from Duke Kunshan University, I have built a robust quantitative foundation and a strong passion for the financial markets that align well with this opportunity.

My academic training, combined with hands-on experiences through internships at CITIC Securities, Google LLC, and CICC, has equipped me with advanced analytical skills and proficiency in programming languages such as Python and SQL. I have developed data pipelines, conducted in-depth statistical analyses, and automated reporting processes, all of which have honed my attention to detail and my ability to manage complex datasets. In addition, my solid knowledge in fixed income instruments—further strengthened by my CFA Level II candidacy—has provided me with a deep understanding of the fixed income market, making me well-prepared to contribute to your team.

What particularly excites me about this role is the opportunity to engage directly with real projects—from pitching trades and analyzing financial data to exploring innovative financing strategies. I am eager to leverage my quantitative skills and fixed income expertise while learning from the esteemed professionals at Deutsche Bank. I am confident that my proactive mindset, technical proficiency, and collaborative spirit will allow me to make a meaningful impact during my internship.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how my background and passion for financial markets can contribute to the success of Deutsche Bank’s Fixed Income & Currencies division.

Sincerely,

Shun Guo (Sean)
