Hiring Manager  
Nova Intelligent Systems  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Quantitative Researcher/Data Scientist position at Nova Intelligent Systems. With a strong academic foundation in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science from Duke Kunshan University, combined with my current pursuit of a Master of Engineering in Fintech at Duke University, I have developed robust quantitative, analytical, and programming skills that align well with the innovative and dynamic environment at your startup.

During my internships at organizations such as CITIC Securities, Google LLC, and CICC, I gained hands-on experience in developing data pipelines, cleaning and analyzing large-scale datasets, and implementing machine learning models. For instance, I built a Python-based data crawler and developed automated reporting tools at CITIC Securities, which sharpened my skills in ETL processes and quantitative analysis. My work at Google LLC and CICC further strengthened my expertise in database management and statistical analysis, both critical components for designing and refining predictive models.

In addition to my professional experiences, my academic projects have allowed me to explore the intersection of finance, mathematics, and technology. I have contributed to projects involving the development of backend APIs for financial data retrieval, as well as conducting rigorous statistical and numerical analyses on complex datasets. These experiences have not only enhanced my technical proficiency in Python, C/C++, and Java, but also instilled a proactive, innovative mindset essential for thriving in a fast-paced startup environment.

I am particularly drawn to Nova Intelligent Systems due to its pioneering approach to automating research and investment processes. I am eager to bring my background in quantitative analysis, machine learning, and data engineering to your team, and I look forward to contributing to the development of sophisticated trading strategies and research infrastructure.

Thank you for considering my application. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences can contribute to the success of Nova Intelligent Systems. I look forward to the possibility of joining your team and working on cutting-edge projects at the forefront of quantitative finance.

Sincerely,

Shun Guo (Sean)
