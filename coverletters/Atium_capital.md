Hiring Manager  
Atium Capital  
Remote (Offices in NJ/NYC/CO)

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Summer Investment & Technology Intern position at Atium Capital. As a current Master of Engineering in Fintech student at Duke University, with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics & Computational Science from Duke Kunshan University, I have developed a unique blend of technical and financial skills that align well with the innovative focus of your firm.

During my internships at CITIC Securities, Google LLC, and CICC, I honed my software engineering capabilities by designing and implementing data pipelines, developing user-centric APIs, and automating complex financial processes. My proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, C/C++, and SQL—combined with my ongoing exploration of modern web development frameworks like React and Node.js—has prepared me to contribute effectively to the development of an in-house investor portal and other internal software workflows at Atium Capital.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have a solid background in finance, as evidenced by my CFA Level II candidacy and my hands-on experience in financial data analysis. This combination enables me to bridge the gap between technology and finance, ensuring that the solutions I develop are not only technically robust but also aligned with the strategic objectives of investment evaluation and product development.

Atium Capital’s mission to offer flexible, high-yield investment opportunities in the small business finance sector excites me, and I am eager to work directly with your C-suite leadership to create secure, user-friendly platforms that enhance investor engagement and transparency. I thrive in fast-paced environments, and my strong analytical, problem-solving, and communication skills will allow me to contribute meaningfully to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how my background in fintech, software engineering, and financial analysis can add value to Atium Capital.

Sincerely,

Shun Guo (Sean)
