# Dividends

## Concept of Dividends and Dividend Policies

Dividend classifications:

* Cash dividend: Distribute cash to shareholders
  * Regular dividends
  * Special/Extra dividends: When price is overvalued
  * Liquidating dividends: When bankruptcy 
* Stock dividend
* Stock split (e.g. 2-for-1 splict)
  * Reverse stock split (e.g. 1-for-20 reverse stock split)

Effects of dividends on shareholders' wealth

* Cash: Stock price will drop by dividend amount, but wealth of shareholder will not change
* Stock: Only change number, will not influnence the wealth

Effects of dividends on financial ratios

* Cash:
  * Reduces A and E in B/S
  * Reduces Liquidity ratio since cash reduces
  * Financial leverage ratio will increase (D/A, D/E) 
* Stock:
  * No effect on A and E, volume increase
  * Price and EPS will decline

|                           | After cash dividends | After stock dividends / split |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Assets (cash)             | Lower                | The same                      |
| Equity                    | Lower                | The same                      |
| Price                     | Lower                | Lower                         |
| EPS                       | The same             | Lower                         |
| P/E                       | Lower                | The same                      |
| Liquidity ratios          | Lower                | The same                      |
| Financial leverage ratios | Higher               | The same                      |

## Dividend Policy

MM theory proposes dividend does not matter. Bird-in-hand argument, Tax argument, Information signaling, and Agency costs theory proposes dividend matters.

* Information signaling: Dividend convey information about the company (positive or negative)
* Agency Cost: 
  * Dividend reduces FCF for managers to overinvest and run out of control
  * Dividend increase default risk on its debt 

### Tax Considerations

#### Double Taxation System

Corporate pretax earnings are taxed at the corporate level and then taxed again at shareholder level if they are distributed to taxable shareholders as dividends.
$$
Div = EBT\times \text{payout\%}(1-t_{corporate})(1-t_{individual\ div})
$$
Then Effective tax rate = $t_{corporate}+(1-t_{corporate})t_{individual\ div}$.

#### Dividend Imputation Tax System

Ensure that profit distributed as dividends are taxed just once, at the shareholder's tax rate.
$$
Div = EBT\times \text{payout\%}(1-t_{individual\ div})
$$
The Effective tax rate is just $t_{indiviaul \ div}$

#### Split-rate Tax System

Corporate earnings that are distributed as dividends are taxed at a lower rate at corporate level than earnings retained.
$$
Div = EBT\times \text{payout\%}(1-t_{corporate})(1-t_{individual\ div})
$$
Then Effective tax rate = $t_{corporate}+(1-t_{corporate})t_{individual\ div}$.

### Dividend Payout Policy

#### Stable Dividend Policy

$$
E(Div) = Div_{t-1}+(E(NI)\times r_{div}-Div_{t-1})\times \text{Adjustment Factor}
$$

where Adjustment factor is $\frac{1}{N}$, $N$ is the number of years over which the adjustment in dividends should take place. 

#### Constant Dividend Payout Ratio Policy

Always pay dividend at a constant payout ratio
$$
Div = r_{div}\times NI
$$
This method is infrequently used because dividend fluctuates with earnings.

## Share Repurchase and Effects

**Share repurchase:** A transaction in which a company buys back its own shares. Repurchased stock are called **Treasury Shares**. They are not considered for dividends, voting or computing EPS.

There are 3 repurchase methods:

* Buy in the market: Flexible in time and amount
* Tender offer
  * Fixed price tender offer: Buy a fixed number of shares at a fixed price, typically at a premium to market
  * Dutch auction: Use auction to determine the lowest price
* Direct negotiation: Typically at premium to market

Effect on EPS:

* Repurcahsed with excess cash
  * A and E will decline, leverage ratio (D/A, D/E) will increase
  * EPS will increase 
* Repurchase with debt
  * D increase and E decline, leverage ratio increase (more than repurchase with cash)
  * If Earning Yield (E/P) > after-tax cost of debt, EPS will increase, decrease otherwise

Epffect on Book Value Per Share:

>[!note]
>
>BVPS = Book value of equity/ shares outstanding

* Decrease if the repurchase price > original BVPS
* Same if repurchase price = BVPS
* Increase else

> [!note]

> Some ratios
>
> * Dividend payout ratio = $\frac{div}{NI}$.
> * Dividend coverage ratio = $\frac{NI}{div}$
> * FCFE coverage ratio = $\frac{FCFE}{div+\text{shares repurchase}}$
> * Warning signals for dividend cut:
>   * Negative external stock market indicators
>   * Extremely high dividend yields.
