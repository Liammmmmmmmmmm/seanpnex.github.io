# Basic of Multiple Regression and Underlying Assumptions

## Use of Multiple Linear Regression 

* Identify relationship
* Test theories (CAPM)
* Forecast

## Multiple Linear Regression

$$
Y_i = b_0 +b_1x_1+b_2x_2+\cdots+b_ix_i+\epsilon
$$

### Assumptions

* Linearity
* Homoskedasity: Variance of error term is same for all observations 
* Normality in error term
* Indendence:
  * Error term uncorrelated
  * No exact linear relation between  independent  variables (Multicolinearity)

Testing assumptions:

* Direct plot (Linearity)
* Variance Inflation Factor(VIF) and Tolerance (1/VIF) $\to$ Multicolinearity
* Correlation Matrix $\to$ Multicolinearity
* QQ-plot $\to$ Normality
* Scatter plot of residual versus variables $\to$ Homoskedascity
